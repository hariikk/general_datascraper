config.py — every setting you can change lives in this file.

Open this file, edit the values between the "=====" markers, save, and run:

    python main.py

The pipeline is:

    search (keywords -> websites)  ->  output/search_results.xlsx
    -> for each paper: try to get its full text (open access only)
         open   -> feed to a local/hosted LLM -> output/extracted_data.xlsx
         closed -> output/closed_source_papers.xlsx

See README.md for a full walkthrough of where everything is and what to change.
